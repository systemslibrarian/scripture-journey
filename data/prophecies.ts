makeLesson(1,"seed-of-the-woman","Seed of the Woman","Lineage",
"Genesis 3:15","1 John 3:8",
"And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.",
"The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work.",
"From the very first pages of Genesis, God promised that a descendant of the woman would one day crush the serpent's head. 1 John reveals that Jesus is that promised offspring—the Son of God who appeared to destroy the devil's work. The battle between good and evil was not an afterthought; it was addressed in God's very first promise of redemption."),

makeLesson(2,"blessing-through-abraham","Blessing Through Abraham","Lineage",
"Genesis 12:3","Galatians 3:16",
"I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.",
"The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say \"and to seeds,\" meaning many people, but \"and to your seed,\" meaning one person, who is Christ.",
"God's promise to Abraham was never just about one nation—it was about all peoples on earth being blessed. Paul explains in Galatians that this singular 'seed' is Christ himself. Through Jesus, the ancient blessing given to Abraham reaches every tribe, tongue, and nation."),

makeLesson(3,"tribe-of-judah","From the Tribe of Judah","Lineage",
"Genesis 49:10","Hebrews 7:14",
"The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he to whom it belongs shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his.",
"For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.",
"Jacob's ancient blessing singled out Judah as the tribe from which the ultimate ruler would come. Hebrews confirms that Jesus descended from Judah—not from the priestly tribe of Levi—establishing that his authority comes not from the old priesthood but from a higher calling as both King and Priest."),

makeLesson(4,"prophet-like-moses","Prophet Like Moses","Ministry",
"Deuteronomy 18:15","Acts 3:22",
"The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him.",
"For Moses said, 'The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you.'",
"Moses was the greatest prophet Israel had ever known—the one who spoke with God face to face. Yet Moses himself said another prophet like him would come. Peter declared in Acts that Jesus is that prophet, the one all Israel was commanded to listen to. Just as Moses delivered Israel from Egypt, Jesus delivers humanity from sin."),

makeLesson(5,"passover-lamb","The Passover Lamb","Passion",
"Exodus 12:46","John 19:36",
"It must be eaten inside the house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.",
"These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: \"Not one of his bones will be broken.\"",
"The Passover lamb's bones were never to be broken—a detail that seemed minor until the crucifixion. When soldiers came to break the legs of those crucified, Jesus had already died, and not one of his bones was broken. John saw this as direct fulfillment: Jesus is the true Passover Lamb whose sacrifice delivers God's people from death."),

makeLesson(6,"son-of-david","Son of David","Lineage",
"2 Samuel 7:12","Luke 1:32",
"When your days are over and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, your own flesh and blood, and I will establish his kingdom.",
"He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,",
"God made a covenant with David that his throne would be established forever. No earthly king could fulfill that promise—every dynasty eventually falls. The angel Gabriel announced to Mary that her son Jesus would receive David's throne, and his kingdom would have no end. Jesus is the eternal King that David's line always pointed toward."),

makeLesson(7,"virgin-birth","Born of a Virgin","Identity",
"Isaiah 7:14","Matthew 1:23",
"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.",
"\"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel\" (which means \"God with us\").",
"Isaiah promised a miraculous sign: a virgin would conceive and bear a son called Immanuel—'God with us.' Matthew saw this fulfilled in the birth of Jesus to the virgin Mary. This was not merely a remarkable birth; it was God entering the human story in the most intimate way possible, literally dwelling among his people."),

makeLesson(8,"light-in-galilee","Light in Galilee","Ministry",
"Isaiah 9:1-2","Matthew 4:16",
"Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress. In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the nations, by the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan—The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned.",
"the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.",
"Galilee was a region looked down upon—remote, mixed with Gentile populations, and historically humbled by foreign invaders. Yet Isaiah said this despised region would be the first to see a great light. When Jesus began his public ministry in Galilee, Matthew recognized the fulfillment: hope dawned first in the place least expected."),

makeLesson(9,"messenger-before-messiah","Messenger Before Messiah","Ministry",
"Malachi 3:1","Mark 1:2",
"\"I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,\" says the LORD Almighty.",
"as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: \"I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way\"—",
"Malachi prophesied that a messenger would come to prepare the way for the Lord. Mark opens his Gospel by identifying John the Baptist as that messenger. Just as a herald goes before a king, John called Israel to repentance so that hearts would be ready to receive the Messiah when he arrived."),

makeLesson(10,"born-in-bethlehem","Born in Bethlehem","Lineage",
"Micah 5:2","Matthew 2:1",
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.",
"After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem",
"Micah named the tiny village of Bethlehem as the birthplace of Israel's future ruler—one whose origins reach back to eternity. Matthew records that Jesus was indeed born in Bethlehem, in fulfillment of this prophecy. The eternal God chose the humblest of towns to enter the world, showing that his kingdom is built not on earthly grandeur but on divine purpose."),

makeLesson(11,"king-priest","King Priest","Identity",
"Psalm 110:4","Hebrews 5:6",
"The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind: \"You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.\"",
"And he says in another place, \"You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.\"",
"The Psalms declared a priest unlike any from Aaron's line—one who would serve forever in the order of Melchizedek. Hebrews identifies Jesus as this eternal priest. Unlike the Levitical priests who served temporarily and died, Jesus holds his priesthood permanently, always interceding for his people before God."),

makeLesson(12,"son-of-god","Declared Son of God","Identity",
"Psalm 2:7","Matthew 3:17",
"I will proclaim the LORD's decree: He said to me, \"You are my son; today I have become your father.\"",
"And a voice from heaven said, \"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\"",
"In Psalm 2, God declares 'You are my son' to his anointed king. At Jesus' baptism, the Father's voice from heaven echoed those very words. This was not merely a title of honor but a declaration of divine identity—the eternal Son stepping into his public mission, affirmed by the Father himself."),

makeLesson(13,"betrayed-by-friend","Betrayed by Friend","Rejection",
"Psalm 41:9","John 13:18",
"Even my close friend, someone I trusted, one who shared my bread, has turned against me.",
"\"I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill this passage of Scripture: 'He who shared my bread has turned against me.'\"",
"David wrote of a trusted friend who shared his bread turning against him. Jesus quoted this psalm at the Last Supper, knowing Judas would betray him. The pain of betrayal by someone close was not a surprise to God—it was written into the story centuries before, showing that even humanity's worst treachery was part of God's redemptive plan."),

makeLesson(14,"thirty-pieces","Thirty Pieces of Silver","Rejection",
"Zechariah 11:12","Matthew 26:15",
"I told them, \"If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, keep it.\" So they paid me thirty pieces of silver.",
"and asked, \"What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?\" So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver.",
"Zechariah named the exact price at which the good shepherd would be valued: thirty pieces of silver, the price of a slave. Centuries later, Judas received precisely that amount to betray Jesus. The specificity of this detail—down to the exact sum—reveals how thoroughly God foresaw and wove every detail of the Messiah's story."),

makeLesson(15,"money-thrown-temple","Money Thrown in Temple","Rejection",
"Zechariah 11:13","Matthew 27:5",
"And the LORD said to me, \"Throw it to the potter\"—the handsome price at which they valued me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter at the house of the LORD.",
"So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.",
"Not only was the betrayal price foretold, but Zechariah also described what would happen to the money: it would be thrown to the potter at the house of the Lord. Matthew records that Judas, overcome with remorse, flung the silver coins into the temple. The chief priests then used the money to buy a potter's field—fulfilling every detail of the ancient prophecy."),

makeLesson(16,"hands-feet-pierced","Hands and Feet Pierced","Passion",
"Psalm 22:16","John 20:25",
"Dogs surround me, a pack of villains encircles me; they pierce my hands and my feet.",
"So the other disciples told him, \"We have seen the Lord!\" But he said to them, \"Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.\"",
"A thousand years before crucifixion was even practiced, the psalmist described having his hands and feet pierced. When Thomas demanded to see the nail marks in Jesus' hands, he was unknowingly confirming the fulfillment of this ancient psalm. The wounds of the cross, far from disproving Jesus' identity, became the very proof that he is the promised Messiah."),

makeLesson(17,"soldiers-cast-lots","Garments Cast Lots","Passion",
"Psalm 22:18","John 19:24",
"They divide my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment.",
"\"Let's not tear it,\" they said to one another. \"Let's decide by lot who will get it.\" This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said, \"They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment.\" So this is what the soldiers did.",
"David described enemies dividing his clothing and gambling for his garment. At the cross, Roman soldiers did exactly that—splitting Jesus' outer garments among themselves and casting lots for his seamless undergarment. John saw this happen and recognized it as Scripture fulfilled, a small, precise detail that no human conspiracy could have staged."),

makeLesson(18,"mocked-on-cross","Mocked While Suffering","Passion",
"Psalm 22:7","Matthew 27:39",
"All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads.",
"Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads",
"The psalmist described being mocked by onlookers who hurl insults and shake their heads. Matthew records this exact scene at Calvary, where passersby taunted Jesus with the very gestures David described. What the world saw as humiliation, Scripture reveals as prophetic fulfillment—every sneer was foreseen, and Jesus endured it willingly."),

makeLesson(19,"given-vinegar","Given Vinegar","Passion",
"Psalm 69:21","Matthew 27:34",
"They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst.",
"There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.",
"The psalmist cried out about being given gall for food and vinegar for thirst—a picture of cruelty added to suffering. At the cross, soldiers offered Jesus wine mixed with gall, a bitter, numbing drink. Even this seemingly minor act of mockery was foretold centuries earlier, underscoring how completely the details of the crucifixion had been written in advance."),

makeLesson(20,"pierced-side","Pierced Side","Passion",
"Zechariah 12:10","John 19:34",
"And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication. They will look on me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn son.",
"Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.",
"Zechariah described the people of Jerusalem looking upon the one they had pierced, mourning as for an only son. At the cross, a Roman soldier pierced Jesus' side with a spear. What Zechariah foresaw as a moment of future mourning and repentance began at Calvary—a pierced Messiah whose wounds would become the source of grace for all who look to him in faith."),

makeLesson(21,"silent-before-accusers","Silent Before Accusers","Passion",
"Isaiah 53:7","Matthew 27:12",
"He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.",
"When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer.",
"Isaiah pictured the Suffering Servant as silent before his accusers—like a lamb led to slaughter, he would not open his mouth. At his trial, Jesus astonished Pilate by refusing to defend himself. His silence was not weakness but strength under control, fulfilling the prophet's vision of a Servant who willingly submitted to injustice to accomplish God's plan."),

makeLesson(22,"suffering-servant","Suffering Servant","Passion",
"Isaiah 53:5","1 Peter 2:24",
"But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.",
"\"He himself bore our sins\" in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; \"by his wounds you have been healed.\"",
"Isaiah 53 is one of the most striking prophecies of the Messiah's suffering: pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our sins, healed by his wounds. Peter quotes these very words and applies them directly to Christ's death on the cross. The Servant's suffering was not meaningless—it was substitutionary, bearing the penalty that belonged to us so that we could be made whole."),

makeLesson(23,"buried-with-rich","Buried with Rich","Passion",
"Isaiah 53:9","Matthew 27:57",
"He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.",
"As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.",
"Isaiah said the Servant would be assigned a grave with the wicked yet buried with the rich. Jesus was crucified between criminals but laid in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy man. This unlikely combination—condemned as a criminal, yet honored in burial—fulfilled both halves of Isaiah's prophecy in a single afternoon."),

makeLesson(24,"resurrection-psalm","Resurrection Foretold","Resurrection",
"Psalm 16:10","Acts 2:31",
"because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, nor will you let your faithful one see decay.",
"Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay.",
"David expressed confidence that God would not let his 'faithful one' see decay. Since David himself died and was buried, Peter argued at Pentecost that David was speaking prophetically about the Messiah. Jesus' resurrection proved that death could not hold him—God's Holy One would never see corruption in the grave."),

makeLesson(25,"ascension","Ascension","Resurrection",
"Psalm 68:18","Ephesians 4:8",
"When you ascended on high, you took many captives; you received gifts from people, even from the rebellious—that you, LORD God, might dwell there.",
"This is why it says: \"When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people.\"",
"The psalm celebrated God ascending victoriously, receiving gifts from the conquered. Paul applied this to Christ's ascension after the resurrection, reframing the image: Jesus ascended to heaven and poured out spiritual gifts on his church. His victory over sin and death was not just for himself but resulted in gifts—apostles, prophets, teachers—given to build up his people."),

makeLesson(26,"right-hand-of-god","Seated at God's Right Hand","Resurrection",
"Psalm 110:1","Acts 2:34-35",
"The LORD says to my lord: \"Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"",
"For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, \"The Lord said to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.'\"",
"In Psalm 110, David called someone 'my Lord' and described God inviting that person to sit at his right hand. Peter pointed out that David never ascended to heaven himself—so he must have been speaking of a greater Lord to come. Jesus' ascension and exaltation to God's right hand fulfilled David's prophecy, confirming his authority over all creation."),

makeLesson(27,"light-to-nations","Light to the Nations","Ministry",
"Isaiah 42:6","Luke 2:32",
"I, the LORD, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles,",
"a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel.",
"Isaiah described God's Servant as a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles. When Simeon held the infant Jesus in the temple, he recognized him as this promised light—a revelation not just for Israel but for all nations. God's salvation was never meant for one people alone; from the beginning, the Messiah was destined to illuminate the whole world."),

makeLesson(28,"healing-ministry","Healing Ministry","Ministry",
"Isaiah 35:5-6","Matthew 11:5",
"Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped. Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy.",
"The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.",
"Isaiah described a future age when the blind would see, the deaf would hear, and the lame would leap for joy. When John the Baptist sent messengers to ask if Jesus was truly the Messiah, Jesus pointed to his miracles—the very signs Isaiah had foretold. His healings were not just acts of compassion; they were credentials proving he was the promised one."),

makeLesson(29,"teach-in-parables","Teaching in Parables","Ministry",

"The psalmist declared he would speak in parables, revealing hidden truths from ancient times. Matthew noted that Jesus taught the crowds entirely in parables, fulfilling this pattern. Jesus' storytelling was not a casual teaching style—it was a prophetic method, concealing deep truths in simple stories so that those with ears to hear could discover the mysteries of God's kingdom."),

"The psalmist wrote of being consumed by zeal for God's house. When Jesus drove the merchants out of the temple with a whip, overturning tables and scattering coins, his disciples recalled this psalm. Jesus' anger was not reckless—it was righteous passion for his Father's house, which had been turned from a place of prayer into a marketplace."),

"The psalmist described a stone that builders threw aside as useless, only for it to become the most important stone in the entire structure. Peter boldly told the religious leaders that Jesus was that rejected stone. The very one the authorities discarded became the cornerstone of God's new building—the church. Rejection by human leaders was part of God's design all along."),

"Zechariah described a king who would arrive not on a warhorse but humbly, riding a donkey. On Palm Sunday, Jesus entered Jerusalem on a young donkey, with crowds waving branches and shouting 'Hosanna.' Matthew recognized this as fulfillment of Zechariah's vision: the Messiah's kingdom is built on humility and peace, not military power."),

"Then Jesus told them, \"This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'\"",
"Zechariah prophesied that when the shepherd was struck, the sheep would scatter. Jesus quoted this very passage on the night of his arrest, warning the disciples they would all flee.

"Daniel saw a vision of one given everlasting dominion over all nations—a kingdom that would never be destroyed. Gabriel told Mary that her son's kingdom would never end.

"Ezekiel promised that God would place one shepherd—his servant David—over his people. Jesus declared himself the Good Shepherd who lays down his life for the sheep.

"Isaiah described the Suffering Servant as despised and rejected—a man of sorrows familiar with pain, from whom people turned their faces. John's Gospel echoes this tragedy: Jesus came to his own people, and his own did not receive him. The Creator entered his creation and was turned away. Yet this rejection opened the door for all who would receive him to become children of God."),

"They crucified two rebels with him, one on his right and one on his left.",
"Isaiah prophesied that the Servant would be numbered with the transgressors—counted among criminals. At the crucifixion, Jesus was placed between two rebels, literally numbered among lawbreakers.

"Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.",
"Isaiah said the Servant would make intercession for the transgressors. Paul declares in Romans that Christ—having died, risen, and ascended—now sits at God's right hand interceding for us.

"Isaiah dared to envision a day when God would swallow up death forever. Paul triumphantly declares that this prophecy will be fulfilled when believers receive their resurrection bodies.

"Daniel saw a vision of God's kingdom receiving absolute sovereignty over all earthly powers.

"For in Scripture it says: \"See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.\"",
"Isaiah described God laying a tested cornerstone in Zion—a sure foundation that would never fail. Peter identifies Jesus as that cornerstone, chosen and precious.

"Isaiah said the Righteous Servant would justify many by bearing their iniquities.

"Isaiah's grand prophecy of a child born and a son given finds its simplest and most powerful echo in the angel's announcement to the shepherds: a Savior has been born in David's town.

"Isaiah said that the Messiah's government and peace would increase without end, upheld by God's own zeal. Gabriel confirmed to Mary that her son would reign over Jacob's descendants forever.

"Isaiah introduced God's chosen Servant, anointed with the Spirit to bring justice to the nations.

"Isaiah described God's Servant as one who would not shout, quarrel, or raise his voice in the streets. Matthew saw this fulfilled in Jesus' ministry—he did not seek public spectacle or political rallies. His gentleness was not weakness but the quiet strength of one who knew his mission. The Messiah's power was displayed not in loud demands but in compassionate service."),

"Isaiah prophesied that God's Servant would open the eyes of the blind and free captives from darkness.

"\"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free,\"",
"Isaiah described the one anointed by God's Spirit to bring good news to the poor, freedom to the captive, and sight to the blind.

"Jeremiah gave the coming king a remarkable name: 'The LORD Our Righteousness.' Paul explains that Christ has become our righteousness—not a righteousness we earn but one we receive.

"Daniel saw 'one like a son of man' approaching God's throne with the clouds of heaven.

"In Zechariah's enacted parable, the shepherd breaks his staff called 'Favor,' symbolizing the end of the covenant relationship.

"Amos prophesied that God would make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight.

Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist, echoed this imagery when he praised God for the 'rising sun' coming from heaven. In Jesus, the long night of waiting ended.

"The opening cry of Psalm 22—'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'—became Jesus' own cry from the cross.

"In the wilderness, those bitten by serpents were healed by looking at a bronze snake lifted on a pole.

"The law declared that anyone hung on a tree bore God's curse. Paul's radical claim is that Jesus willingly took on this curse in our place.

"The psalmist asked why nations rage against God and his anointed. The early church saw this psalm fulfilled when Herod, Pilate, the Gentiles, and Israel's leaders united against Jesus.

"The psalmist celebrated how God draws praise from the mouths of children. When children in the temple courts shouted 'Hosanna to the Son of David,' the religious leaders were indignant.

"David declared that God desired not ritual sacrifice but willing obedience: 'Here I am, I have come.' Hebrews applies these words to Christ entering the world—not with an animal offering, but with his own body prepared to do God's will. Jesus replaced an entire sacrificial system with the one offering God truly wanted: a life of perfect obedience."),

makeLesson(73,"throne-forever","Your Throne, O God","Identity",
"Psalm 45:6-7","Hebrews 1:8-9",
"Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.",
"But about the Son he says, \"Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.\"",
"In Psalm 45, a royal wedding psalm, the king is addressed as 'God' and given an eternal throne. Hebrews directly applies these words to the Son, declaring that Jesus' throne is God's throne—everlasting and righteous. This is one of the clearest Old Testament affirmations of the Messiah's divine nature, celebrated in the context of a joyful coronation."),

makeLesson(74,"hated-without-reason","Hated Without Reason","Rejection",
"Psalm 69:4","John 15:25",
"Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head; many are my enemies without cause, those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal.",
"But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me without reason.'",
"The psalmist lamented being hated without cause—his enemies outnumbered the hairs on his head. Jesus quoted this very verse, telling his disciples that the world's hatred was not because of anything wrong in him but was the fulfillment of Scripture. Unreasonable hatred of the innocent is not random injustice; it was foretold, and Jesus bore it knowingly."),

makeLesson(75,"kings-bring-gifts","Kings Bring Gifts","Identity",
"Psalm 72:10-11","Matthew 2:11",
"May the kings of Tarshish and of distant shores bring tribute to him. May the kings of Sheba and Seba present him gifts. May all kings bow down to him and all nations serve him.",
"On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.",
"The psalm envisioned a day when kings from distant lands would bring gifts and bow before Israel's ruler. When the Magi—scholars from the East—arrived with gold, frankincense, and myrrh and fell down to worship the infant Jesus, this royal homage began to be fulfilled. Even as a baby, Jesus drew the reverence of foreign dignitaries."),

makeLesson(76,"unchanging-creator","The Unchanging Creator","Identity",
"Psalm 102:25-27","Hebrews 1:10-12",
"In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded. But you remain the same, and your years will never end.",
"He also says, \"In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end.\"",
"The psalmist praised God as the Creator who will outlast his own creation—the heavens will wear out like old clothes, but God remains unchanged. Hebrews applies these very words to the Son, declaring Jesus as the unchanging Creator. Everything else ages, fades, and passes away, but Jesus remains the same yesterday, today, and forever."),

makeLesson(77,"let-another-take-his-place","Another Takes His Place","Rejection",
"Psalm 109:8","Acts 1:20",
"May his days be few; may another take his place of leadership.",
"\"For,\" said Peter, \"it is written in the Book of Psalms: 'May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,' and, 'May another take his place of leadership.'\"",
"The psalmist's curse on a treacherous enemy included the wish that another take his position. Peter applied these words to Judas after his betrayal and death, using them as scriptural warrant for choosing Matthias to replace him among the twelve apostles. Even the vacancy left by the betrayer was covered by Scripture, ensuring the apostolic foundation remained complete."),

makeLesson(78,"ever-hearing-never-understanding","Ever Hearing, Never Understanding","Rejection",
"Isaiah 6:9-10","Matthew 13:14-15",
"He said, \"Go and tell this people: 'Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.' Make the heart of this people calloused; make their ears dull and close their eyes.\"",
"In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: \"You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving. For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes.\"",
"God warned Isaiah that the people would hear his words but not understand, see his works but not perceive. Jesus cited this prophecy to explain why he spoke in parables—many heard his teaching but refused to grasp its meaning. Spiritual blindness is not merely a failure to understand; it is a calloused heart that chooses not to see what is plainly before it."),

makeLesson(79,"branch-from-jesse","Branch from Jesse","Lineage",
"Isaiah 11:1-2","Luke 3:22",
"A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit. The Spirit of the LORD will rest on him—the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the LORD—",
"and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: \"You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.\"",
"Isaiah saw a shoot rising from the stump of Jesse, David's father—an image of new life from what appeared to be a dead dynasty. The Spirit of the Lord would rest on this Branch in fullness. At Jesus' baptism, the Holy Spirit descended visibly, and the Father spoke his approval. The dead stump of David's fallen kingdom had produced its greatest Branch."),

makeLesson(80,"root-of-jesse","Root of Jesse","Kingdom",
"Isaiah 11:10","Romans 15:12",
"In that day the Root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples; the nations will rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious.",
"And again, Isaiah says, \"The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations; in him the Gentiles will hope.\"",
"Isaiah described the Root of Jesse as a banner around which the nations would rally. Paul quoted this to emphasize that Jesus' mission extends to all peoples—Gentiles included. The Messiah is not just Israel's king but the hope of the entire world. Every nation finds its rallying point in him, and his resting place—his eternal kingdom—will be glorious."),

makeLesson(81,"voice-in-the-wilderness","Voice in the Wilderness","Ministry",
"Isaiah 40:3","Matthew 3:3",
"A voice of one calling: \"In the wilderness prepare the way for the LORD; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.\"",
"This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: \"A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'\"",
"Isaiah heard a voice calling for a highway to be built in the wilderness for God. Matthew identifies John the Baptist as that voice—preparing the way not through road construction but through calling people to repentance. Before the King arrives, hearts must be made ready. John's wilderness preaching leveled the mountains of pride and filled the valleys of despair."),

makeLesson(82,"light-for-the-gentiles","Light for the Gentiles","Ministry",
"Isaiah 49:6","Acts 13:47",
"he says: \"It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel I have kept. I will also make you a light for the Gentiles, that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth.\"",
"For this is what the Lord has commanded us: \"I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.\"",
"God told his Servant that restoring Israel alone was too small a task—he would be a light for the Gentiles, bringing salvation to earth's ends. Paul and Barnabas quoted this when they turned their mission to the Gentiles. The gospel was never meant for one people only; from the beginning, God's plan was a salvation so vast it encompasses every corner of the globe."),

makeLesson(83,"back-to-those-who-beat","Back to Those Who Beat Me","Passion",
"Isaiah 50:6","Matthew 26:67",
"I offered my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard; I did not hide my face from mocking and spitting.",
"Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him",
"The Servant in Isaiah willingly offered his back to beatings, his cheeks to those who tore out his beard, and his face to mocking and spitting. Matthew records Jesus enduring exactly this treatment—spit on, struck, slapped—after his trial. The Servant did not resist or hide. His willingness to absorb violence without retaliation revealed a strength deeper than any display of power."),

makeLesson(84,"appearance-disfigured","Appearance Disfigured","Passion",
"Isaiah 52:14","Mark 15:17-19",
"Just as there were many who were appalled at him—his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being and his form marred beyond human likeness—",
"They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him. And they began to call out to him, \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him.",
"Isaiah warned that the Servant's appearance would be so disfigured that people would be appalled. Mark's account of Jesus' flogging, the thorns jammed onto his head, and the repeated blows to his face show this prophecy in agonizing detail. The one who was the radiance of God's glory chose to have his human form marred beyond recognition for the sake of those he came to save."),

makeLesson(85,"he-took-our-infirmities","He Took Our Infirmities","Ministry",
"Isaiah 53:4","Matthew 8:17",
"Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted.",
"This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: \"He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases.\"",
"Isaiah described the Servant bearing human pain and suffering. Matthew applies this not to the cross but to Jesus' healing ministry—every sick person he healed was a partial fulfillment of this prophecy. Jesus did not merely cure symptoms; he took upon himself the weight of human brokenness. His compassion was not optional; it was his prophetic calling."),

makeLesson(86,"beautiful-feet","Beautiful Feet","Ministry",
"Isaiah 52:7","Romans 10:15",
"How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, \"Your God reigns!\"",
"And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: \"How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!\"",
"Isaiah celebrated the beauty of the messenger who brings good news—peace, salvation, the reign of God. Paul applied this to the gospel messengers who carry the news of Christ to the world. The message itself is glorious, but even the feet that carry it are called beautiful. Every person who shares the good news walks in the footsteps of Isaiah's vision."),

makeLesson(87,"everlasting-covenant","Everlasting Covenant","Resurrection",
"Isaiah 55:3","Acts 13:34",
"Give ear and come to me; listen, that you may live. I will make an everlasting covenant with you, my faithful love promised to David.",
"God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay. As God has said, 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.'",
"Isaiah invited the people into an everlasting covenant rooted in God's faithful love promised to David. Paul declared that Jesus' resurrection secured those promises forever—because the risen Christ will never decay, the blessings of David's covenant are now sure and permanent. The resurrection is not just a miracle; it is the guarantee that God's ancient promises will never expire."),

makeLesson(88,"rachel-weeping","Rachel Weeping for Her Children","Passion",
"Jeremiah 31:15","Matthew 2:18",
"This is what the LORD says: \"A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.\"",
"\"A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.\"",
"Jeremiah described Rachel—the mother of Israel—weeping inconsolably for her lost children. Matthew saw this fulfilled in Herod's massacre of the infants in Bethlehem. The coming of the Messiah did not shield the world from evil; instead, he entered into a world of real suffering. Even the Savior's birth was accompanied by tears, foreshadowing the sorrow he would ultimately bear."),

makeLesson(89,"god-sets-up-kingdom","God Sets Up a Kingdom","Kingdom",
"Daniel 2:44","Revelation 11:15",
"In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever.",
"The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: \"The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign for ever and ever.\"",
"Nebuchadnezzar's dream revealed a succession of earthly empires, all crushed by a kingdom set up by God that would never be destroyed. Revelation shows the final fulfillment: every kingdom of this world becomes Christ's eternal domain. Human empires rise and crumble, but the kingdom God established through Jesus endures forever—unshakeable and unending."),

makeLesson(90,"pour-out-my-spirit","Pour Out My Spirit","Kingdom",
"Joel 2:28","Acts 2:17",
"And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.",
"'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.'",
"Joel foresaw a day when God's Spirit would be poured out on all people—sons and daughters, old and young alike. Peter declared this fulfilled at Pentecost when the Spirit fell on the believers and they spoke in tongues. The Spirit that once rested on select prophets and kings now fills every believer, making the entire community of faith a prophetic people."),

makeLesson(91,"three-days-in-the-deep","Three Days in the Deep","Resurrection",
"Jonah 1:17","Matthew 12:40",
"Now the LORD provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish three days and three nights.",
"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.",
"Jonah's three days in the belly of the great fish became, in Jesus' words, a sign pointing directly to his own death and resurrection. Just as Jonah emerged alive after three days in the deep, Jesus would emerge alive from the tomb. What seemed like the end of Jonah's story was actually a rescue—and the same pattern held true at Easter."),

makeLesson(92,"rebuild-davids-tent","Rebuild David's Fallen Tent","Kingdom",
"Amos 9:11-12","Acts 15:16-17",
"\"In that day I will restore David's fallen shelter—I will repair its broken walls and restore its ruins—and will rebuild it as it used to be, so that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations that bear my name,\" declares the LORD, who will do these things.",
"'After this I will return and rebuild David's fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it, that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who bear my name, says the Lord, who does these things'—",
"Amos prophesied that God would restore David's fallen shelter so that all nations might seek the Lord. James quoted this at the Jerusalem Council to support the inclusion of Gentile believers. The rebuilding of David's tent is not a physical reconstruction—it is the gathering of all peoples into the family of God through Jesus, the son of David."),

makeLesson(93,"my-servant-the-branch","My Servant, the Branch","Identity",
"Zechariah 3:8","Luke 1:78",
"Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.",
"because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven",
"Zechariah announced the coming of God's servant, called 'the Branch'—a title laden with messianic meaning. Zechariah the priest, father of John the Baptist, echoed this when he praised God for the 'rising sun' from heaven. The Branch imagery speaks of new growth from David's line—fresh, living, fruitful. In Jesus, the royal line that seemed cut off sprouted to life again."),

makeLesson(94,"priest-on-his-throne","Priest on His Throne","Identity",
"Zechariah 6:12-13","Hebrews 8:1-2",
"Tell him this is what the LORD Almighty says: 'Here is the man whose name is the Branch, and he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the LORD. It is he who will build the temple of the LORD, and he will be clothed with majesty and will sit and rule on his throne. And he will be a priest on his throne. And there will be harmony between the two.'",
"Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by a mere human being.",
"Zechariah described the Branch building the Lord's temple and serving as both king and priest on his throne—roles that were always separate in Israel. Hebrews reveals Jesus as this unique figure: a high priest who sat down on heaven's throne, serving in the true sanctuary. In Christ, the crown and the priestly garments are united in one person, bringing perfect harmony between God's rule and his mercy."),

makeLesson(95,"elijah-will-come","Elijah Will Come","Ministry",
"Malachi 4:5-6","Matthew 11:14",
"See, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before that great and dreadful day of the LORD comes. He will turn the hearts of the parents to their children, and the hearts of the children to their parents; or else I will come and strike the land with total destruction.",
"And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.",
"Malachi closed the Old Testament with a promise that Elijah would return before the great day of the Lord. Jesus declared that John the Baptist was the Elijah who was to come. John did not come with Elijah's fire, but with his Spirit and power—calling families and a nation to repentance, turning hearts back to God, preparing the way for the day of salvation."),

makeLesson(96,"feet-on-mount-of-olives","Feet on Mount of Olives","Kingdom",
"Zechariah 14:4","Acts 1:11-12",
"On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south.",
"\"Men of Galilee,\" they said, \"why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.\" Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives.",
"Zechariah prophesied that the Lord's feet would stand on the Mount of Olives. It was from the Mount of Olives that Jesus ascended into heaven, and the angels promised he would return the same way. The geography is precise: the exact hill Zechariah named is where Jesus departed and where the promise of his return was given. The story is not over—it awaits its final chapter."),

makeLesson(97,"cut-off-from-the-living","Cut Off from the Living","Passion",
"Isaiah 53:8","Acts 8:33",
"By oppression and judgment he was taken away. Yet who of his generation protested? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was punished.",
"\"In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.\"",
"Isaiah described the Servant being taken away by oppression and judgment, cut off from the land of the living. The Ethiopian eunuch was reading this very passage when Philip met him on the desert road. Philip explained that this was about Jesus—unjustly condemned, killed for others' transgressions. The ancient prophecy became the gateway to faith for a man from the ends of the earth."),

makeLesson(98,"sons-of-the-living-god","Sons of the Living God","Kingdom",
"Hosea 1:10","Romans 9:26",
"Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they will be called 'children of the living God.'",
"and, \"In the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they will be called 'children of the living God.'\"",
"Hosea declared that those once called 'not my people' would be called children of the living God. Paul applied this to the inclusion of Gentiles in God's family—those who were once outsiders are now beloved children. The story of Scripture ends where it began: with God's relentless desire to have a people he calls his own, drawn from every nation on earth.")
